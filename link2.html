<h2>Beginning</h2>
<p>The history of the car can be traced back to the late 19th century, when the first self-powered vehicles were developed. The early pioneers of the automobile industry, such as Karl Benz and Henry Ford, played a crucial role in the development and popularization of the car. Benz's invention of the first gasoline-powered automobile in 1886 is considered a pivotal moment in the history of the car. Ford's introduction of the Model T in 1908, which was affordable and accessible to the masses, further revolutionized the industry and made car ownership a reality for many people. Over the following decades, the car industry continued to evolve, with advancements in engine technology, safety features, and overall design, ultimately transforming the way we travel and live.</p>
